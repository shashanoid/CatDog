# CatDog
This is a simple neural network that classifies cats and dogs. 
The labelled training data and test data is inside the "data" folder under .npy files. 
Training data is formatted as numpy arrays of inputs and outputs with 1 being a cat and 0 being a dog. 

#To train the network
- Customize the number of layers and neurons you want in the train.py file.
- "python train.py" to train the network which will also test the network against the training data for each epoch.
